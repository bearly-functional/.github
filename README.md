# Bearly Functional Ltd.

## Howdy! 👋

We are a small software development company based in the UK, with a passion for building uncluttered, functional software that makes you smile when you use it.

## Our Mission

We believe that software should be a joy to use, and beautiful to look at, at the same time.
There is no reason you should feel like you are fighting with your software, or that it is getting in the way of your work.
Our goal therefore is to find what makes people miserable, and fix it with a product that is a joy to use.

## What Do We Do?

We can't tell you that yet, but we are working on it! 🤫

## Contact

We do not want to hear from recruiters, or individuals looking to invest in our company, thank you.
